# Nami Contract

The backend was written in Solidity and I used [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) as my environment. I used [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/) to deploy my contract to the Goerli testnet. You can check out the corresponding frontend [here](https://github.com/ArKane-6418/Nami-Frontend).
